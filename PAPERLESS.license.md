I absolutely love simplicity in setup and usage of
[Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/) project.
Besides, I find
[paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/) code very
clean and elegant.

Long story short, I decided to refactor Papermerge to be similar in setup and
usage experience as Paperless. This change will apply since Papermerge version 1.3.0 (now work in progress).

Codebase of the two projects is absolutely different, but configuration file
(the /etc/papermerge.conf) is the same. You may find that a great deal of
documenation will overlap. It is because Papermerge projects follows the good
practice of paperless and document everything in great detail.
