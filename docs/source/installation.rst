Installation
=============

Papermerge has two parts:
 
    * `Web App <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge>`_
    * `Worker <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge-worker>`_ - which is used for OCR operation

Depending on your needs both Worker and Web App can run on same machine  or
you can setup a fully distributed application with as many workers (each on
separate machine) you need.

I developed, tested and deployed only on Linux machines, just because I am linux user.
Theorethically installation should be easy to adopt for MacOS machines.  


Development
############

It takes some effort to setup a development environment. But each and every installation step is
documented very well, there shoudn't be any doubt left.


Production
