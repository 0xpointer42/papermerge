Language Support
*******************

Starting with version 1.3.0 (which is now in development) Papermerge can OCR
any language. By default, it is shipped with a preset of :ref:`21 languages
<languages>`. Basically, as of version 1.3.0, developers don't need to change
application's code to have additional languages support.
