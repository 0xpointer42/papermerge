Contributing
**************

This documents describes in detail how you can contribute to papermerge project.

Fix a Typo
==========

Contribute to the project just by fixing text typos. Like tis one. Yes, English is not my
native lnguage and I do lots of typoz.

Fixing documentation typos is easiest and fastest way to contribute to the
project. Even even if you correct one minor typing mistake I will add you to
the list of contributors.


Open an Issue
===============

Another way to contribute is open issues. Obviously this means you need to at least run once application and test it.


Add Your Language Support
==========================

Adding language support is not so trivial as fixing a typo or open an issue, but it is not that difficult either.
In any case, there is a separate :ref:`page in developer guide <dev_lang_support>` for it.
