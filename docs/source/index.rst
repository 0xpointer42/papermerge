Welcome to papermerge's documentation!
======================================

I have nothing against paper. Paper is brilliant humanity invention. But in
21th centry I find it more appropiate for paper based documents to be
digitized (scanned). Once scanned, appropiate software can be used to
find any document in fraction of second by just typing a few keywords.


Papermerge is document management system designed to work with scanned
documents. It provides look and feel of major modern file browsers with
hierarchical structure of files and folders.
