Welcome to papermerge's documentation!
======================================

I have nothing against paper. Paper is brilliant humanity invention. But in
21th centry I find it more appropiate for paper based documents to be
digitized (scanned). Once scanned, appropiate software can be used to find any
document in fraction of second by just typing a few keywords.


Papermerge is document management system designed to work with scanned
documents. Besides OCR with full text search, it provides look and feel of
major modern file browsers with hierarchical structure of files and folders,
so that you can organize your documents in very similar way to Dropbox (via Web)
or Google Drive.
