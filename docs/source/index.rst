Welcome to Papermerge's documentation!
======================================

I have nothing against paper. Paper is a brilliant invention of humanity. But in the
21st century I find it more appropriate for paper-based documents to be
digitized (scanned). Once scanned, appropriate software can be used to find any
document in a fraction of a second, just by typing a few keywords.


Papermerge is a document management system designed to work with scanned
documents. As well as OCR with full text search, it provides the look and feel of
major modern file browsers, with a hierarchical structure for files and folders,
so that you can organize your documents in a similar way to Dropbox (via web)
or Google Drive.
