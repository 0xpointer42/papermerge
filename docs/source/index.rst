Welcome to papermerge's documentation!
======================================

I have nothing against paper. Paper is brilliant humanity invention. But in
21th centry I find it more appropiate for paper based documents to be
digitized (scanned). Digitized documents are easier to work with, we live in
world of computers and Internet afterall.
