Setup
=====

Papermerge has two parts:
 
    * `Web App <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge>`_
    * `Worker <https://github.com/ciur/papermerge-worker>`_ - which is used for OCR operation

Depending on your needs both Worker and Web App can run on same machine  or
you can setup a fully distributed application with as many workers (each on
separate machine) you need.
