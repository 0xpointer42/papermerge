Languages Support
===================

Theorethically all languages supported by tesseract (over 130) can be used.

But for my own needs only two were required:

    * German 
    * English

Thus, only support for these two languages is provided. Both localization (of user interface)
and OCRing documents in german and english are basically hardcoded into the project.
