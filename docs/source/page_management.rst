Page Management
=================

.. important::

    This feature is work in progress. Page management feature will be part of
    1.2.0 release.

Page management is new set of features of Papermerge to *manage* pages. In
other words you can delete, reorder, cut and paste pages.

Many times scanning documents in bulk results in documents with blank pages;
some pages my be out of order or maybe part of totally different document.
Even if user notices these flaws immediately it is time consuming and
frustrating to redo scanning process. Thus it is a welcome feature of
Papermerge to allow user to fix out of order pages in application.
