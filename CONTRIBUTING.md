Here you will find general description about how you can contribute to papermerge project.

## Fix a Typo

Contribute to the project just by fixing text typos. Like tis one. Yes, English is not my
native lnguage and I do lots of typoz.

Fixing documentation typos is easiest and fastest way to contribute to the
project. Even even if you correct one minor typing mistake I will add you to
the list of contributors.

least run once application and test it.
