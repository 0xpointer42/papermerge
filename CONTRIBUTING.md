# Contributing to Papermerge

## Fix a Typo

Contribute to the project just by fixing text typos. Like tis one. Yes, English is not my
native lnguage and I do lots of typoz.

Fixing documentation typos is easiest and fastest way to contribute to the
project. Even even if you correct one minor typing mistake I will add you to
the list of contributors (first paragraph of current file is excluded from
this rule).


## Open an Issue.

Another way to contribute is open issues.
